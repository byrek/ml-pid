This repository was created while writing a series of articles demonstrating the practical implementation of ML models on STM32 processors. The goal of this series is to investigate and practically compare to what extent the new ML technology can replace the solutions used so far.

The complete set of articles is available at: https://hardwarehax.com/posts/pid-vs-ml-part1/
